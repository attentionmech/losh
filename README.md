Local-first orchestrator for the LLM experiments.

## Features

- local-first: targeting local-experiments with local llms as first class citizens
- opinionated: defaults for everything, to allow anyone to start within minutes of install

## What it is NOT

- not a resource-manager: not concerned with infra/processes etc. though basic api to cancel/top runs
- not a dumb tracker: it is for LLMs and hence, the overall approach is to not ignore that we are dealing with models and take decisions aligned with that
