Lightweight Experiment Runner for LLM

## Features

- local-first: targeting local-experiments with local llms as first class citizens
- opinionated: defaults for everything, to allow anyone to start within minutes of install
- lightweight: simple and lightweight, least possible path towards getting things done
- llm experiments oriented: target is to solve this little more than what notebooks do, but not a replacement
