## Get started

1. clone repo

2. `pip install -r requirements.txt`

3. `python losh.py loshfiles/sample.yml`

## Rough shape 

- llm experiments oriented: target is to solve this little more than what notebooks do, but not a replacement
- local-first: targeting local-experiments with local llms as first class citizens
- opinionated: defaults for everything, to allow anyone to start within minutes of install
- common building blocks: quantization, finetuning, etc.
- high-level recipies: yaml config of what experiment should be
- lightweight: avoid bulking up where possible
- reproducibility: should be able to rerun similar to jupyter notebooks
